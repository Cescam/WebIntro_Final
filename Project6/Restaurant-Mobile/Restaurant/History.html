			<h1>WELCOME TO MIAMI GRILL</h1>
			<p id="soda">IT’S OFFICIAL. MIAMI SUBS IS NOW MIAMI GRILL-WHERE WE’VE GOT EVERYTHING. FROM SALADS AND WINGS, TO CHEESESTEAKS AND GRILLED MAHI MAHI, IF IT’S ON YOUR MIND IT’S ON OUR MENU.</p>
		

<p id="water">The vibrant brand that Miami Grill is today all started with a single restaurant in Key West, Florida in 1988: Mr. Submarine. From there, the brand experienced rapid growth as “Miami Subs” during the 90’s, garnering a cult-like following through its distinctive Miami-inspired design and delicious made-to-order meals like Wings, Cheesesteaks, Fresh Angus Burgers, and authentic Greek-style Gyros. But food was just the beginning. In 2012, Miami Subs partnered with international music sensation Pitbull to truly take the brand ‘worldwide’. Far from just a sub shop, today Miami Grill continues to offer more to everyone, including grilled Mahi Mahi, Wraps and even beer and wine, all in a sleek new concept with a South Beach vibe. In other words, at Miami Grill, everything goes.</p>
